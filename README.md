## üöÄ Getting Started

Since BlockPledge isn‚Äôt deployed to a test blockchain, you‚Äôll need to run it locally. Follow these steps to set up and explore the platform:

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v18 or later)
- **MetaMask** browser extension
- **Hardhat** (install globally with `npm install -g hardhat` or use locally)

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jtakaendisa/blockpledge-decentralized-crowdfunding.git
   cd blockpledge-decentralized-crowdfunding
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**

   - Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory.
   - Copy the variables from .env.example and fill in your Firebase, EmailJS, and Pinata credentials.

4. **Launch a Local Blockchain**

   - Open a terminal and run:
     ```bash
     npx hardhat node
     ```
   - This starts a local blockchain server for testing. Keep this terminal running.

5. **Deploy Smart Contracts**

   - In a new terminal, deploy the contracts to your local network:
     ```bash
     npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network localhost
     ```
   - Note the contract address output in the console for reference.

6. **Set Up MetaMask**

   - Open MetaMask and connect to the **Localhost 8545** network.
   - Import an account using one of the private keys from the Hardhat node (check the terminal running `npx hardhat node` for account details).

7. **Start the Frontend**
   - Launch the Next.js app:
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```
   - Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.
